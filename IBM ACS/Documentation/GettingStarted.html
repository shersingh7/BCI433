<hr><h3><a id="3.0"></a>3.0 Prerequisites</h3>
<h3><a id="3.1"></a>3.1 Prerequisites (workstation)</h3>
<p>
IBM i Access Client Solutions will run on most operating systems that support
Java 8.0 or higher including various versions of Linux, Mac and Windows.
<p>
Recommendation:<br>
Keeping your version of Java at the most current version will make sure you have
all the latest fixes and security patches. 
<p>
One way to check the version of Java installed on your system is to bring up a
prompt where a command may be entered (Command Prompt, Shell, Terminal, etc) and
then type the command:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java -version
<p>
The following output indicates version 8.0 is installed:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java version "1.8.0_65"<br>
The 65 in this example refers to the update level.

<p>
Here are some web sites of Java providers.  Make sure you are running with the
most up-to-date version of Java for your platform.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://openjdk.java.net/install<br>

<p>
Tech Note for Mac:<br>
When installing Java on Mac, select a JDK instead of a JRE.  The JRE for Mac installs Java for only the browser.
It does not install Java for other applications.  Installing the JDK will make Java available to other
applications such as IBM i Access Client Solutions.

<h3><a id="3.2"></a>3.2 Prerequisites (Connectivity to IBM i)</h3>
<p>
IBM i Access Client Solutions will connect to IBM i releases 5.4 and above.

<hr><h3><a id="5.0"></a>5.0 Installation</h3>
<p>
The packaging of IBM i Access Client Solutions provides several installation options from the
very simple single user installation, to the more advanced multi-user installations.
<p>
Installation scripts have been provided in the Mac_Application, Linux_Application, and Windows_Application
folders (see section <a href="#4.0">4.0 Product Contents</a>) which can be used for a variety of installation options.

<p>
For a single user installation on Mac, Linux, and Windows, or a multi-user installation on a Windows PC, see the <a href="./QuickStartGuide_en.html">QuickStartGuide</a>.
The QuickStartGuide explains how to use the provided installation scripts for doing these types of simple installs.
<p>
If you are an administrator planning on deploying this to several users, you will want to read
the article <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ibmi/library/i-ibmi-access-client-solutions-customization-trs/">IBM i Access Client Solutions: Customization and deployment made easy</a>.
The article explains how an administrator can pre-customize the installation for multiple users prior to deployment by 
using the /AdminConfig option supported by the installation scripts.
<p>
For administrators that would like to automate the install in silent mode, use the /AdminConfig 
parameter to pre-configure the installation.  Then use the /Q parameter during the actual installation. For Example:<br>
<pre>
    Windows_Application\install_acs_64.js /AdminConfig
    Windows_Application\install_acs_64.js /Q
</pre>

<p>
In addition to the above options, you also have the option of just unpacking the zip archive to any location of your
choice. This can be any location where the workstation has read authority to access the files.  This includes the
local hard disk drive, a remote network (shared) drive or portable media such as a CD or USB flash drive.  Unpacking the
zip archive completes the installation.

<p>
Technical Note:<br>
Some archive utilities do not preserve all the saved file attributes.  For
example, on Mac and Linux platforms, the unzip command is usually a better choice
than the jar command.  For additional information, see section <a href="#6.0">6.0 File
Permissions</a>.

<h3><a id="5.1"></a>5.1 Updating an Existing Installation</h3>
<p>
Enhancements and fixes will be made available on a periodic basis.  These updates
are provided as a complete product installation.  When these updates are
available, you will need to update your existing installation.
<p>
To update an existing installation that was installed by using the installation scripts,
extract the contents of a newer version of the product.  Invoke the installation script from this
new version in the same manner as was done during the initial installation.  This will update the
product files without changing the users existing configuration.
<p>
For administrators maintaining a version of the product in a central location accessed by
multiple users, you may extract the contents of the newer version over the top of the
existing version.
If you have made custom changes to the AcsConfig.properties file, you will want
to save AcsConfig.properties before extracting the contents of the new version of the product over
an existing version.  After you have extracted the contents of the new version of the product and
have restored AcsConfig.properties, your users can run the install script in the same manner as 
the initial installation to update their installation.
<p>
If you chose to install the product without using the installation scripts by extracting the
contents of the zip archive to some location of your choice, then to update the product, you will need
to extract the contents of the newer version of the product over the top of the existing version.
Keep in mind you may need to save and restore the contents of AcsConfig.properties if you made custom changes to it.

<hr><h3><a id="6.0"></a>6.0 File Permissions</h3>
<p>
<a href="#7.0">Section 7.0 Starting the Product</a> describes several different ways to start
IBM i Access Client Solutions.  If you will be using one of the provided binary
files or scripts to start the product, you will need to make sure its file
permissions have the execute permission enabled.  The file permissions assigned
while unpacking the zip archive file are determined by several factors including
the operating system, the archive utility used to unpack the zip archive, the
authority of the user, etc.
<p>
If you have trouble using one of the provided binary files or scripts, check
the file permissions.  The following sections describe some methods for
checking the file permissions.


<h3><a id="6.1"></a>6.1 File Permissions (Linux, Mac, AIX)</h3>
<p>
For unix-like operating systems, you can use the following command from a shell
or terminal prompt to check the permissions of a file:<br>
<pre>    ls -l &lt;file&gt;   			</pre>
<p>
To change the permissions of a file, you can use the following command:<br>
<pre>    chmod &lt;permission&gt; &lt;file&gt;	</pre><br>
For example,<br>
to add read and execute permission for everyone:
<pre>
    chmod a+rx &lt;file&gt;
</pre>
to give the owner of the file read/write/execute permission and only read/execute
for everyone else:
<pre>
    chmod 755 &lt;file&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Additional help for the ls and chmod commands is readily available on the
internet.



<h3><a id="6.2"></a>6.2 File Permissions (Windows)</h3>
<p>
For Windows, while viewing the file using Windows explorer, right-click the
file and select properties.  The security tab should contain the file
permissions.  Make sure you have Read and Execute permission.
<p>
On recent versions of Windows, you may also use the icacls command to view
and change the permission of a file.




<hr><h3><a id="7.0"></a>7.0 Starting the Product</h3>
<p>
There are multiple ways to start IBM i Access Client Solutions.
If you used the installation scripts to install the product, the easiest way
to start the product is found in the <a href="./QuickStartGuide_en.html">QuickStartGuide</a>.
<p>
If the product was not installed using the installation scripts, the remainder of this
section will describe alternative ways to start the product.
Since there are a variety of ways and locations how/where java can be
installed, some of the methods may require additional configuration.  If
one of the methods below does not work, try a different method. In some
cases, additional guidance is provided.  You may also find section
<a href="#11.0">11.0 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> helpful.
<p>
When using a binary file or script as described below, the binary file
or script must be in the directory structure contained in the zip
archive.  For convenience, you may also copy/move the binary file(s)
and/or scripts for your platform(s) to the same directory where the
acsbundle.jar exists.


<h3><a id="7.1"></a>7.1 Starting the Product</h3>
<p>
To start the product from a file viewer (e.g. Windows Explorer,
Mac OS X Finder, etc) using a platform specific binary file, locate the
sub-directory in Start_Programs that identifies your operating system and
hardware architecture.
<p>
Locate the binary file your operating system recognizes. Then double-click
it to start the product.
You may also start the product with this binary file from a Command Prompt,
Terminal, or Shell.
<p>
If you get the following error:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Error loading Java module."<br>
IBM i Access Client solutions could not find a java installation in a
location it recognizes.  You may try one of the following methods in sections:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#7.1.1">7.1.1 Starting the Product - Additional Options</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#7.2">7.2 Starting the Product (using a script)</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#7.3">7.3 Starting the Product (using the command-line)</a><br>
<p>
Tech Note for Mac:<br>
If you are prompted to install a "Java 6 SE runtime", you do not need to install
Java 6.  Install Java 8 and then try to start the product again.
If you are using acslaunch_mac to start the product and you continue to get
prompted to install "Java 6 SE runtime", then Go to Utilities and start a
Terminal session. Run the following commands and then try to start the product again:
<pre>
    sudo mkdir -p /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk
    sudo mkdir -p /System/Library/Java/Support/Deploy.bundle
   
</pre>


<h3><a id="7.1.1"></a>7.1.1 Starting the Product - Additional Options</h3>
<p>
You may also try one of the following methods when trying to use the binary
file for your platform.  These methods allow you to identify which Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) should be used to start the product.  See section
<a href="#7.1.2">7.1.2 Finding the Java Home Path</a> for how to locate the Java home path on
your workstation.  These additional methods are only supported on Linux and
Windows platforms:
<ul>
<li>Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the java home path   (OR)
<li>Use the -vm option on the binary command to specify the java home
      path.  Specify -h on the binary command for additional help    (OR)
<li>Copy a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) directory structure to the
      same directory as the binary file you are trying use.
</ul>


<h3><a id="7.1.2"></a>7.1.2 Finding the Java Home Path</h3>
<p>
If you can start the product using one of the methods in section:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#7.2">7.2 Starting the Product (using a script)</a>  (OR)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#7.3">7.3 Starting the Product (using the command-line)</a><br>
then you can determine the java home path on your workstation from the
IBM i Access Client Solutions main GUI.  On the menu bar, select<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help-&gt;About<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The java.home path is displayed on this panel.<br>
<p>
The java.home property contains the location of the java home path for your
workstation.  This is the path you will need to specify when setting the
JAVA_HOME environment variable or when using the -vm option on the command.

<h3><a id="7.1.2.1"></a>7.1.2.1 Finding the Java Home Path (on Windows)</h3>
<p>
On Windows platforms, search for java.exe.  The java binary is normally
located in either a bin or jre/bin sub-directory below the Java home path.
The Java home path may be used when setting either the JAVA_HOME environment
variable or when using the -vm option on the command.

<h3><a id="7.1.2.2"></a>7.1.2.2 Finding the Java Home Path (on Linux)</h3>
<p>
On linux you can use the "which" command:<br>
<pre>
    which java
</pre>
This will give you a path to the java command or a symbolic link to it.
<p>
Resolve any symbolic links until you finally get to the actual binary file
for the java command.  You can resolve symbolic links by using the ls
command with the -l option:<br>
<pre>
    ls -l &lt;file&gt;
</pre>
The java binary is normally located in either a bin or jre/bin sub-directory
below the Java home path.  The Java home path may be used when setting either
the JAVA_HOME environment variable or when using the -vm option on the command.



<h3><a id="7.2"></a>7.2 Starting the Product (using a script)</h3>
<p>
Beginning with v1r1m5, the Start_Scripts directory has been renamed to Sample_Scripts 
and placed in the Documentation directory.
<p>
The preferred way to start the product is by using a platform specific
binary file available in Start_Programs.  The scripts in Sample_Scripts
should only be used if the platform specific binary does not work.
<p>
To start the product from a file system browser (e.g. Windows Explorer,
Mac OS X Finder, etc) using one of the supplied scripts, locate the script in
the Sample_Scripts sub-directory that is compatible with your operating system.
<p>
Most non-Windows based operating systems have perl available by default.  The
Sample_Scripts/Linux_Mac_Other directory contains a perl script (with three
different file extensions) which can be used to start the product on any
platform where perl is available.  Select the file that has a file extension
that your operating system will recognize as a perl script.
<p>
Windows based operating systems have JScript available by default.  The
Sample_Script/Windows directory contains a JScript that can be used to start
the product on Windows operating systems.
<p>
Using a platform specific method to browse your file system (e.g. Windows
Explorer, Mac OS X Finder, etc), locate the script your operating system
recognizes.  Then, double-click it to start the product.
You may also start the product with this script from a Command Prompt,
Terminal, or Shell.



<h3><a id="7.3"></a>7.3 Starting the Product (using the command-line)</h3>
<p>
You may also start the product from the command-line from any place you can
enter a command (Command Prompt, Terminal, Shell, etc)<br>
<pre>
    java -Xmx1024m -jar &lt;path&gt;/acsbundle.jar
</pre>
where &lt;path&gt; is the location to the product's executable jar file<br>
<br>
For Example:<br>
<pre>
    java -Xmx1024m -jar V:/some_location/acsbundle.jar
</pre>
or
<pre>
    &lt;java_path&gt;java -jar V:/some_location/acsbundle.jar
</pre>
where &lt;java_path&gt; is the location of the java command for JDK 6.0 or higher.
<p>
See section <a href="#7.1.2">7.1.2 Finding the Java Home Path</a> for determining the complete
path to the java command.
<p>
You may also use any of the programs or scripts from the command-line. For example:<br>
<pre>
    /Product/Location/Start_Programs/Linux_x86-64/acslaunch_linux-64
    /Product/Location/Start_Programs/Mac_i386-32_x86-64/acslaunch_mac
    C:\Product\Location\Start_Programs\Windows_x86-64\acslaunch_win-64.exe
</pre>
<p>
Technical Note:<br>
On most platforms, the Java Virtual Machine heap space defaults to a maximum
size that is too small to utilize multiple functions within the IBM i Access
Client Solutions product.  A one gigabyte maximum heap size (-Xmx1024m) is
the recommended minimum size.  Specifying sizes smaller than one gigabyte or
using the default heap size may produce an OutOfMemoryException.




<hr><h3><a id="8.0"></a>8.0 Configuration</h3>
<p>
Add a system configuration for each IBM i system you want to use or manage.  To
add a system configuration, select System Configurations from the Management
tasks. Then select New.  On the General tab, enter the System name.  To get
started, the System name is all that is necessary for performing General tasks.
<p>
When you have finished, select OK to save the information you entered for this
system, or select Save/New if you have additional systems you would like to add
to the configuration.
<p>
You may add new systems to your configuration or update existing configurations
using the General, Connection, or the Console tabs at any time.
<p>
For Console tasks, additional configuration is required.  Console configurations
are automatically associated with the System name you entered on the General tab.
To enter the console configuration for a system, select System Configurations
from the Management tasks.  Select New or Edit.  Then select the Console tab.
The 5250 Console task requires a configured LAN console or a configured HMC
console. If you do not have a configured LAN or HMC console, see section
<a href="#9.9">9.9 Establishing a Console Connection to IBM i</a>.
<p>
The Hardware Management Interface task requires a configured hardware management
interface.  You may enter up to two hardware management interface configurations.
<p>
When you have finished, select Close on the System Configurations panel.
<p>
Using the System drop-down box on the main IBM i Access Client Solutions panel,
select a System.  All Console tasks automatically associate the selected System
(entered on the General tab) with the console configuration (entered on the
Console tab).
<p>
You may now select a task for the selected system.  If you select a Console task
which does not have the corresponding information entered on the Console
configuration tab, an error message will be displayed.



<h3><a id="8.1"></a>8.1 Configuration Location</h3>
<p>
By default, each user will have their own unique location for their
configuration. The configuration root directory is determined in a platform
dependent manner.  The configuration directories will be created during the
initial start-up.  To see where the configuration directory is:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start the product (see section <a href="#7.0">7.0 Starting the Product)</a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edit-&gt;Preferences<br>

<h3><a id="9.2"></a>9.2 File Associations</h3>
<p>
Some configuration files generated by IBM i Access Client Solutions are supported
from the command-line when they are provided as the first and only parameter.
When these files with specific file extensions are provided as the first
parameter, IBM i Access Client Solutions will associate the file with the
function to be invoked and provide the file as input to that function.
<p>
The following extensions have file association support:
<pre>
    .dttx   - Data Transfer upload request
    .dtfx   - Data Transfer download request
    .hod    - 5250 emulator session profile
    .bchx   - multiple session emulation profile
    .ws     - 5250 emulator session profile (Personal Communications)
    .bch    - multiple session emulation profile (Personal Communications)
</pre>
Command-line examples:
<pre>
    acslaunch_xxx dt_download_file.dtfx - runs the saved download operation
    acslaunch_xxx dt_upload_file.dttx   - runs the saved upload operation
    acslaunch_xxx system_lp13ut20.hod   - starts a 5250 session to the system
</pre>
...where acslaunch_xxx is the command-line syntax used for starting the product. See
section <a href="#7.3">7.3 Starting the Product (using the command-line)</a>.
<p>
These supported command-line file associations enable the user to manually
set up operating system (OS) specific file associations.  Since file associations
are platform dependent, the steps required depend on the OS.
</p>
The reason you may want to consider setting up file associations for your OS is
so you have the ability to double-click a file (of one of the above supported
file types) to start the designated function.
<p>
The following sections provide some examples of setting up file associations for
some operating systems.


<h3><a id="9.2.1"></a>9.2.1 File Associations (for Windows)</h3>
<ol>
<li>From the main GUI menu bar, select Tools-&gt;File Associations...
<li>Select the file types you want to create file associations for.
<li>Select OK
</ol>
<p>
The appropriate IBM i Access Client Solution function will now run when you
double-click files with this type.


<h3><a id="9.2.1.1"></a>9.2.1.1 Change Icon (for Windows Shortcut)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Locate the shortcut previously created for the binary file appropriate for
   your hardware architecture (acslaunch_win-32.exe OR acslaunch_win-64.exe)
<li>Right-click and select Properties
<li>Select the Shortcut tab
<li>Click the Change Icon... button
<li>Select the icon to be used for this shortcut
<li>Select OK
<li>Select OK
</ol>

<h3><a id="9.2.2"></a>9.2.2 Setting up a Desktop Icon (for Linux)</h3>
<p>
Follow the steps in the <a href="./QuickStartGuide_en.html">QuickStartGuide</a> for Linux.  This will install the
application to /opt/ibm/iAccessClientSolutions.  It will also create: 
/usr/share/applications/IBM i Accesss Client Solutions.desktop
<p>
To create an icon for the product on your desktop, copy the above .desktop
file to your Desktop folder.  You may need to adjust the permissions of file
on your desktop so that it is executable.


<h3><a id="9.2.2.1"></a>9.2.2.1 File Associations (for Linux)</h3>
<p>
The steps required for setting file associations will depend on the Linux
distribution and the desktop environment being used.  In general, the steps
required will be similar to the above steps used for Windows.
<ol>
<li>Locate a file you want to associate that contains a supported extension (e.g.
   .hod, .bchx, .dtfx, or .dttx)
<li>Right-click the file. Look for options or properties that allow you to
associate a program with the file.
<li>Associate the file and/or its extension with the appropriate IBM i Access
Client Solutions binary file or launch script.
</ol>


<h3><a id="9.2.3"></a>9.2.3 File Associations (for Mac)</h3>
<p>
In order to use File Associations on a Mac, the file type must be associated with
an application.  Follow the steps in the <a href="./QuickStartGuide_en.html">QuickStartGuide</a> for Mac
so IBM i Access Client Solutions is an installed application.

<h3><a id="9.2.3.1"></a>9.2.3.1 Create File Associations (for Mac)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Use Finder to locate a file you want to associate that contains a supported
   extension (e.g. .hod, .bchx, .dtfx, or .dttx)
<li>Select the file and then File-&gt;Get Info
<li>Under the "Open with:" option select Other
<li>Browse to the location of the IBM i Access Client Solutions application.
<li>Select the application.
<li>Check the box to Always Open With.  Select Add.
<li>Back at "Open with:" select Change All.  Select continue to any dialog.
</ol>
<p>
The appropriate IBM i Access Client Solution function will now run when you
double-click files with this type.


<h3><a id="9.2.3.2"></a>9.2.3.2 Change Icon (for Mac)</h3>
<p>
Use the Preview application to locate the Icons folder within the product
directory and use Finder to replace the icon in Get Info.
<ol>
<li>From Preview, select File-&gt;Open
<li>Locate the product Icons directory
<li>Select the file that contains the Icon and then Open
<li>Select Edit-&gt;Select All
<li>Select Edit-&gt;Copy
<li>From Finder, locate the .hod, .bchx, .dtfx, or .dttx file whose icon is to
   be changed.<br>
   If the file is already on your desktop, click it to select it.  Otherwise,
   Select Go-&gt;Go To Folder and then enter the path to the file and then Go.<br>
   Click the file to select it.
<li>File-&gt;Get Info
<li>Click the icon at the top of Get Info
<li>Edit-&gt;Paste
</ol>


<h3><a id="9.3"></a>9.3 Changing Configuration Location</h3>
<p>
By default, each user will have their own unique location for their
configuration. The configuration location can be changed by setting the property:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.AcsBaseDirectory<br>
This property exists inside the AcsConfig.properties file.
<p>
The AcsConfig.properties file exists in two locations when the product is
shipped. It is contained inside the acsbundle.jar file.  For convenience, it is
also provided in the product zip archive file and will be in the same directory
as the acsbundle.jar file when the zip archive is unpacked.
<p>
During start-up, the product will only use the first AcsConfig.properties file
it finds.  It first checks the directory where the acsbundle.jar file exists.
If AcsConfig.properties is not found in the same directory as the acsbundle.jar
file , it will use the AcsConfig.properties file inside the acsbundle.jar file.
<p>
You may choose to update AcsConfig.properties in acsbundle.jar with a custom
configuration path.  If you do, make sure the directory where acsbundle.jar
exists does not contain an AcsConfig.properties file or it will get used instead.
This provides the flexibility of being able to distribute the configuration
location with the acsbundle.jar file while also providing the flexibility to
override it.
<p>
Special keywords are provided which can be used when defining the configuration
path.  When the keywords are used in the specified path, the keywords will be
substituted with the text or path they define.  Only one keyword can be used
in the configuration path.  The special keywords and their meanings are:<br>
<pre>
	{USER} - The current user id. This keyword can be anywhere in the path
</pre>
<p>
The following keywords can only be at the beginning of the specified path:
<pre>
	{PRODUCTDIR} - the path to the same directory as acsbundle.jar
	{TEMPDIR}    - the path to a platform specific temporary directory
	{ROOT}       - the path to the root of the file system
	{HOME}       - the path to the user's home directory
	{DEFAULT}    - the default path the product would normally use
</pre>
<p>
Technical Note:<br>
We do not recommend sharing a configuration between multiple users.
For example, if X were a shared network drive, the following setting may
cause unpredictable results:
<pre>
    com.ibm.iaccess.AcsBaseDirectory=X:/Shared_Network_drive/config_directory
</pre>
<p>
There are several problems with multiple users sharing this configuration path:<br>
<ol>
<li>Unpredictable results will occur if multiple users simultaneously use the
   configuration.
<li>This example assumes each user has the X drive mapped to the same location.
<li>Using a network drive in the configuration would not work from a Linux or
   Mac client.  Using the provided keywords, as in the examples below,
   will work on Windows, Linux and Mac.
</ol>
<p>
When sharing a configuration path between multiple users, the {USER}
keyword should be used to avoid collisions with other users.  It will
be substituted with the user id of the current user.
<p>
When setting the configuration path, use a forward slash ('/') instead of a
backward slash ('\') as the directory separator.  This will work on all
operating systems including Windows.
<p>
Here are some recommended sample configurations:
<p>
Example 1 - local configuration for current user (default):
<pre>
    com.ibm.iaccess.AcsBaseDirectory=
</pre>
When AcsBaseDirectory is not set, the configuration defaults to a platform
dependent path for the user.
This is the default setting for IBM i Access Client Solutions.
<p>
Example 2 - remote (or local) configuration unique for each user:
<pre>
    com.ibm.iaccess.AcsBaseDirectory={ROOT}/config_directory/{USER}/
</pre>
The configuration will be remote or local based on the location of {ROOT}.
<p>
Example 3 - remote (or local) configuration unique for each user:
<pre>
    com.ibm.iaccess.AcsBaseDirectory={PRODUCTDIR}/config_directory/{USER}/
</pre>
The configuration will be remote or local based on the location of {PRODUCTDIR}.
<p>
Example 4 - local configuration on portable media (like USB drive):
<pre>
    com.ibm.iaccess.AcsBaseDirectory={PRODUCTDIR}/config_directory
</pre>
Since the path to the portable media will vary depending on the system where
it is being used, this setting allows the configuration to be relative to
the product files.  In this example, the {USER} keyword was intentionally not
specified so the configuration on the USB drive would be used by the user of
the USB drive, regardless of the user ID.


<h3><a id="9.4"></a>9.4 Other Deployment Options</h3>
<p>
Here are some other deployment options you may want to consider:
<ul>
   <li>Deploy the product in a single location where it can be accessed by
     several users.
   <li>If you have a web server, you may want to consider using Web Start.
	 See http://java.com/en/download/faq/java_webstart.xml
   <li>Automatically import configuration settings.
     See section <a href="#9.4.1">9.4.1</a>
   <li>Deploy natively on the IBM i. See section <a href="#9.4.2">9.4.2</a>
</ul>

<h3><a id="9.4.1"></a>9.4.1 Automatically import configuration settings</h3>
<p>
The following properties may be used in the AcsConfig.properties file to
automatically set up a configuration for new users or to update a
configuration for existing users:<br>
<pre>
   com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport
   com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport.version
</pre>
<p>
Here are the necessary steps:
<ol>
<li>Create the configuration you want to propagate to one or more users.
<li>Export the configuration to a file using File-&gt;Export Configuration from
   the main GUI or use the command line option in section <a href="#9.1.1">9.1.1 Backup</a>.
<li>Move the configuration file to the desired location.  There are several
   available options described later.
<li>Set the com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport property in AcsConfig.properties to
   the path of the configuration file.
<li>Set the com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport.version to an integer value that
   represents the version of the configuration file.
</ol>
<p>
Here is how it works:<br>
The saved configuration referenced by the com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport property
will be automatically imported when the integer value of the
com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport.version property mismatches the last value that
was imported.  In addition to providing a way to set up an initial
configuration and provide updates to an existing configuration, this also
provides a way to back-level a configuration.  The configuration will be
updated anytime there is a mismatch between the integer value of the version
property with the last version that was imported.  However, while an imported
configuration may change the configuration for an existing system in the user's
configuration, a system will never be deleted from the user's configuration.
<p>
The path for the com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport property may be specified as an
absolute path, a URL or with keywords defined in section <a href="#9.3">9.3</a>.  For example:
<pre>
    com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport=C:/acs_bak.zip<br>
    com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport=file///C:/acs_bak.zip<br>
    com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport=http://your.company.com/path/file/acs_bak.zip<br>
    com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport=ftp://your.company.com/path/file/acs_bak.zip<br>
    com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport={PRODUCTDIR}/acs_bak.zip<br>
</pre>
<p>
Additional flexibility is provided by allowing the configuration file to be
distributed within acsbundle.jar or in the same directory as acsbundle.jar.
For either case, set com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport with the name of the file
without a preceding path:<br>
<pre>
    com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport=acs_bak.zip
</pre>
<p>
A special value of * is allowed for com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport.version:
<pre>
    com.ibm.iaccess.autoimport.version=*
</pre>
<p>
This will always import the configuration regardless of any previous version.

<h3><a id="9.4.2"></a>9.4.2 Native IBM i Deployments</h3>
<p>
Some of the command-line plugins that do not require a GUI can be used natively on the IBM i.
For example, you can use Data Transfer to extract data from your database into a spreadsheet file type
directly on the IBM i without downloading the data to the PC.
<p>
To do this, you can extract the product zip archive to any place in the IBM i Integrated File System (IFS).
For example, if you extracted the product zip archive to:
<pre> /home/AccessClientSolutions </pre>
And you have a previously saved Data Transfer download request that exists at:
<pre> /some_path/qcustcdt.dtfx </pre>
You can run the following command on the IBM i:
<pre>
QSH CMD('java -jar /home/AccessClientSolutions/acsbundle.jar /plugin=dtbatch /some_path/qcustcdt.dtfx')                                            
</pre>

<h3><a id="9.5"></a>9.5 Customized Packages</h3>
<p>
IBM i Access Client Solutions provides system administrators the ability to
restrict the usage of specific functions by setting the following property in

The system administrator may choose to restrict access to specific functions
by updating the AcsConfig.properties file.  Restricting access will remove the
function from the main GUI and disable its usage from the command line.
<p>
One example of how to restrict functions would be to add the following line
to the AcsConfig.properties file:<br>
<pre>
    com.ibm.iaccess.ExcludeComps=OPCONSOLE,HWCONSOLE,L1CPLUGIN
</pre>
If the system adminstrator would like to update the AcsConfig.properties file
inside acsbundle.jar before deploying it to their users, an example of how to
do that is:<br>
<pre>
    jar uvf acsbundle.jar AcsConfig.properties
</pre>
Refer to section <a href="#9.3">9.3 Changing Configuration Location</a> for additional information
about how IBM i Access Client Solutions determines which AcsConfig.properties
file to use.


<h3><a id="9.6"></a>9.6 Migrating from IBM i Access for Windows</h3>
<p>
IBM i Access Client Solutions configuration files are not compatible with the
corresponding functions in IBM i Access for Windows.  IBM i Access Client
Solutions provides a migration path for several key items as discussed in the
following sections.

<h3><a id="9.6.1"></a>9.6.1 Migrating System Configurations</h3>
<p>
The Copy Connections function available from the main GUI menu at
File-&gt;Copy Connections provides an interface for copying system configurations
between IBM i Access Client Solutions and the legacy Windows configuration
supported by IBM i Access for Windows.  For additional information, see the help
for the main panel of Copy Connections.

The system configurations may also be migrated using the command line.  See
section <a href="#9.1.25">9.1.25 MIGRATE</a> for additional information.

<h3><a id="9.6.2"></a>9.6.2 Migrating 5250 Emulation</h3>
<p>
5250 emulation files used by the IBM i Access for Windows Personal Communications
emulator can be converted by using the 5250 Session Manager in IBM i Access
Client Solutions. The following file types can be converted from Personal
Communications:<br>
<pre>
   .ws   - emulator profile
   .bch  - emulator batch file
   .kmp  - keyboard customization file
   .pmp  - poppad files
   .bar  - menu bar files
</pre>
The files will be converted to:<br>
<pre>
   .hod  - emulator profile
   .bchx - emulator batch file
   .kmp  - keyboard customization file
   .pmp  - poppad files
   .bar  - menu bar files
</pre>
The .kmp, .pmp, and .bar file types are used by both products.  However the formats are
not compatible. The converted files will be created in an IBM i Access Client
Solutions specific path.
<p>
The conversion of these files can be initiated from the IBM i Access Client
Solutions Session Manager menu by:
<ul>
<li> selecting File-&gt;Import and then locating the Personal Communications files.
<li> dragging and dropping the file into the IBM i Access Client Solutions Session
Manager window.
</ul>
...or from the command-line by using the PM5250 plugin.  See section <a href="#9.1.30">9.1.30 PM5250</a>.

<p>
A macro conversion utility is available.  From the Session Manager:<br>
<pre>
    Tools-&gt;Convert Macro...
</pre>
Technical Note:<br>
The macro conversion utility may not be able to convert a PC5250 macro if the
macro is a custom macro that contains more than just recorded key strokes.  

<h3><a id="9.6.3"></a>9.6.3 Migrating Saved Data Transfer Request Files</h3>
<p>
Data Transfer in IBM i Access Client Solutions provides a wizard for
converting saved Data Transfer request files that were generated by
IBM i Access for Windows.
<p>
The following file types can be converted from IBM i Access for Windows:<br>
<pre>
   .dtf - data transfer from IBM i
   .dtt - data transfer to IBM i
</pre>
The files will be converted to:
<pre>
   .dtfx - data transfer from IBM i
   .dttx - data transfer to IBM i
</pre>
The Data Transfer migration wizard does not migrate .fdf files. The new
file type required by IBM i Access Client Solutions is of the type .fdfx
and can be generated during a download or by using the Create File Wizard.
<p>
The Data Transfer migration wizard is available from the Data Transfer
main menu by selecting Actions-&gt;Data Transfer Migration

<h3><a id="9.6.4"></a>9.6.4 EHLLAPI</h3>
<p>
For 5250 applications which leverage EHLLAPI when accessing the Personal
Communications emulator shipped with IBM i Access for Windows, refer
to the following KB article for information about using EHLLAPI with
IBM i Access Client Solutions:<br>
<pre>
    http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010639
</pre>

<h3><a id="9.6.5"></a>9.6.5 Kerberos</h3>
<p>
IBM i Access Client Solutions has support for kerberos.  To use kerberos
when connecting to a system:<br>
<ol>
<li>Bring up System Configurations from the main GUI
<li>Select New or Edit an existing system configuration
<li>On the Connection tab, select<br>
   "Use kerberos authentication; do not prompt"
</ol>
Setting up a kerberos environment is beyond the scope of this document.




<h3><a id="9.7"></a>9.7 Key Management</h3>
<p>
Managing certificates for Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connections is available
from the main GUI by selecting Tools-&gt;Key Management.  Some tasks on the
Key Database require the keystore integrity passphrase.

<h3><a id="9.8"></a>9.8 Data Transfer</h3>
<h3><a id="9.8.1"></a>9.8.1 Data Transfer Support for Excel and Calc Spreadsheets</h3>
<p>
In addition to supporting downloads to a File, Data Transfer also
supports downloads to an active spreadsheet for either Microsoft's Excel
spreadsheet or OpenOffice's Calc spreadsheet.  To download to an active
spreadsheet, the main Data Transfer GUI panel provides the option to select
an Output Device.  By default, the Output Device is File.  If your platform
supports interaction with the Excel and/or Calc spreadsheet, additional
options for an Active Excel Spreadsheet and an Active Calc Spreadsheet can
be selected from the Output Device drop down box.
<p>
Restrictions:
<ul>
<li>A minimum version of OpenOffice 3.4.1 is required on Windows.
<li>A minimum version of OpenOffice 4.2.1 is required on Linux and Mac and must be
installed to the default location.
<li>IBM i Access Client Solutions running on Linx or Mac only supports interaction with OpenOffice.<br>
IBM i Access Client Solutions running on Windows supports interaction with either Microsoft Excel or
OpenOffice Calc.
<li>The bitness of OpenOffice must match the bitness of IBM i Access Client Solutions.<br>
Explanation: OpenOffice is available in both 32bit and 64bit versions.  Both versions are capable of running on a 64 bit PC.
When interacting with an OpenOffice spreadsheet, the bitness of OpenOffice and IBM i Access Client Solutions must be the same
or Data Transfer will not be able to interact with the spreadsheet.
The bitness of IBM i Access Client Solutions is determined by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) where it
is running.  When there is a bitness mismatch between OpenOffice
and the JVM running IBM i Access Client Solutions and you select an active
spreadsheet for the Output Device, an error similar to "Active Spreadsheet was not found"
will be displayed.  If you are running on a 64 bit PC, you may start IBM i Access
Client Solutions using either the 32 bit or 64 bit binary launcher specific to
your platform.  In order for the active spreadsheet support to work, start IBM i
Access Client Solutions using the platform specific binary that matches the
bitness of the OpenOffice application being used.
<br>Since Mac only supports a 64 bit JVM, you must install the 64 bit version of
OpenOffice in order to use the active spreadsheet support on Mac.
</ul>

<h3><a id="9.8.2"></a>9.8.2 Data Transfer Support for Character Truncation and Numeric Overflow</h3>
<p>
During a Data Transfer upload request, if a character or numeric field
exceeds the defined size of the field, the upload request will terminate.
<p>
To enable character fields to be truncated from the end, set the following property
in the AcsConfig.properties file:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.dataxfer.jdbc.AllowCharacterTruncation=true
<p>
To enable numeric fields to be set to their maximum positive or negative
value when the provided numeric field exceeds the defined boundary, set the
following property in the AcsConfig.properties file:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.dataxfer.jdbc.AllowNumericOverflow=true
<p>
When these properties are set to true, the upload request will continue
without providing any indication that truncation or overflow occurred.  Character
fields will be truncated at the end.  Numeric fields will be set to their maximum
value for overflow and their minimum value for underflow.
<p> 
Alternatively, the above properties can be set from from the command line like
other java properties as follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Dcom.ibm.iaccess.dataxfer.jdbc.AllowCharacterTruncation=true<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Dcom.ibm.iaccess.dataxfer.jdbc.AllowNumericOverflow=true

<h3><a id="9.8.3"></a>9.8.3 Data Transfer Sheet Name</h3>
<p>
During downloads, a sheet name is generated based on the name of the IBM i source library and file
with ">Sheet#" appended where # is replaced with the appropriate sheet number.  For example:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qiws.qcustcdt>Sheet1<br>
<p>
To override the library and file portion of the sheet name, you may specify the following property:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.dataxfer.SheetId=your_string<br>
This will generate:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your_string>Sheet1

<h3><a id="9.9"></a>9.9 Establishing a Console Connection to IBM i</h3>
<p>
To perform administrative functions on the IBM i, a 5250 console is required.
IBM i Access Client Solutions supports both LAN and HMC console configurations.
<p>
If you know the Service host name or Service IP address for your IBM i  or the
host name or IP address for your HMC console, you can configure the console
information within IBM i Access Client Solutions using the following steps:<br>
<ol>
<li>Start IBM i Access Client Solutions on your PC.
<li>On the main panel, click System Configurations.
<li>Click the New button to enter a new configuration or the Edit button to update
   an existing configuration
<li>Select the Console tab
<li>Enter the appropriate information for your console type.
</ol>
<p>
For an IBM i where the console configuration does not yet exist (e.g. a new
system just delivered to your business), an IP address for a console connection
will be automatically assigned in the range of 169.254.62.0 - 169.254.62.63
during the IPL. For these cases, the following steps will help establish a
console connection using IBM i Access Client Solutions:<br>
<ol>
<li>Disable your PC's wireless connectivity.  The following steps require the
   wired ethernet port.
<li>Run an ethernet cable between your PC and the IBM i T1 port.
<li>Start IBM i Access Client Solutions on your PC.
<li>On the main panel, click System Configurations.
<li>From System Configurations, click the Locate Console... button.
<li>From the IBM i Locator panel, click on the Search button.
<li>If the IPL sequence on the IBM i has progressed far enough for the automatic
   IP address to be a assigned, the IP address should be displayed on the Search
   panel.
<li>Click the displayed IP address to select it, then click on the Console button
   to connect a 5250 console.
<li>A panel will appear asking for Service Tools credentials.
<li>Upon entering valid credentials, a 5250 console will be displayed.
<li>The console can be used to handle initial install and setup tasks.
</ol>
<p>
When you are ready to add the IBM i system to the rest of your network
infrastructure, there is additional information in the IBM InfoCenter for how to
configure the Service Tools LAN Adapter:
<p>
<pre>
http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v7r1m0/topic/rzamh/rzamhsrvtoolsrvr4dstdst.htm
</pre>
See section "Configuring the service tools server for DST"

<p>
For IBM i systems that already have a LAN console configuration and are already
in your network infrastructure, the following steps may be used to find existing
console configurations:<br>
<ol>
<li>Start IBM i Access Client Solutions on your PC.
<li>On the main panel, click System Configurations.
<li>From System Configurations, click the Locate Console... button.
<li>On the IBM i Locator panel, update the Near field to an IP address in the
   range you want to search.
<li>Click the Search button to find LAN consoles in the specified range.
<li>Click the displayed IP address to select it, then click on the Console button
   to connect a 5250 console.
<li>A panel will appear asking for Service Tools credentials.
<li>Upon entering valid credentials, a 5250 console will be displayed.
</ol>



<h3><a id="9.10"></a>9.10 Additional Fonts</h3>
<p>
Additional fonts for 5250 emulation may be added to the Fonts directory.
<p>
To provide alternative and/or multiple locations for additional fonts, set the
com.ibm.iaccess.Fonts property located in the AcsConfig.properties file.
<p>
The default Fonts directory may be overridden by setting the
com.ibm.iaccess.Fonts property to a:<br>
<ol> 
<li>&lt;path&gt; which is a directory containing fonts
<li>&lt;path&gt;/&lt;filename&gt; of a specific font file (e.g. .ttf)
<li>URL to a font file
<li>a semi-colon delimited list of any of the above
</ol>
<p>
Note:<br>
The &lt;path&gt; may be an absolute path or a relative path starting from the location
of acsbundle.jar. Only monospaced fonts will be recognized by 5250 emulation.
<p>
Example 1 (default):
<pre>
     com.ibm.iaccess.Fonts=Fonts	
</pre>
Example 2:
<pre>
     com.ibm.iaccess.Fonts=/Users/All/Fonts;Fonts
</pre>



<h3><a id="9.11"></a>9.11 Using Credentials from a netrc File</h3>
<p>
To enable the usage of a .netrc file (Linux and Mac) or a _netrc file (Windows),
go to the IBM i Access Client Solutions main GUI and from the menu bar, select<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edit-&gt;Preferences<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General tab<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check the box: <b>Read netrc file for login information</b><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Apply button<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart IBM i Access Client Solutions<br>          
<p>
The standard format of a netrc file is:<br>
<pre>
     machine &lt;system&gt; login &lt;user-id&gt; password &lt;password&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The netrc file must be stored in the user's home directory and the system name and user-id
must match <b>System Configurations</b>.  From IBM i Access Client
Solutions:<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select System Configurations<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select and then Edit the system<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connections tab<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select <b>Use default user name to prompt once for each system</b><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill in the user-id for: <b>Default user name</b><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select OK<br>          

<p>
When the system name and <b>Default user name</b> match the contents of the netrc file,
a connection to the system will be made using the password from the netrc file without
prompting the user.

<h3><a id="9.12"></a>9.12 Integrated File System (IFS)</h3>
<h3><a id="9.12.1"></a>9.12.1 IFS, QFileSvr.400, and Security</h3>
<p>
The Integrated File System Support uses the QFileSvr.400 file system to copy or send objects
from one IBM i partition to another. This means the user profile and password on both partitions
must match, and the partitions must have the same password level system value (QPWDLVL).
If using Kerberos authentication, both partitions must have Network Authentication Service and
Enterprise Identity Mapping (EIM) configured. For more details, see the topic "Security and object
authority in the QFileSvr.400 file system" in the IBM i Knowledge center.
<p>
The connections to other IBM i partitions made by the QFileSvr.400 file system are not secure.
If a secure connection is needed when copying or sending objects from one IBM i partition to another,
the configuration for the partition must be setup to use SSL, System Configurations must have the
"Use SSL for connection" option selected for that partition, and the following property must be set in the
AcsConfig.properties file:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.ifs.transferMechanism=ACS
<br>
Alternatively, the property can be set from from the command line like other java properties as follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Dcom.ibm.iaccess.ifs.transferMechanism=ACS<br>

<h3><a id="9.12.2"></a>9.12.2 IFS Authority</h3>
<p> 
The Integrated File System support requires authority to use the following CL commands:<br>
<pre>
    CPY
    CPYFRMSTMF
    CPYTOSTMF
    CRTDIR
    CRTLIB
    CRTSAVF
    RMVDIR
    RST
    SAV
    SETASPGRP
 </pre>
<p>
If the user cannot use these CL commands, the Copy, Paste, Send, Delete, and New Folder actions
will fail.

<h3><a id="9.12.3"></a>9.12.3 IFS Limitations</h3>
<p>
The Integrated File System support does not allow actions for objects which have paths that
start with /QFileSvr.400, /QNTC, or /QOPT.  If the current directory path or any selected object
path starts with /QFileSvr.400, /QNTC, or /QOPT, all items in the Actions menu will be disabled
and a context menu will not be displayed.

<h3><a id="9.12.4"></a>9.12.4 IFS and Independent ASPs</h3>
<p>
The Integrated File System support does not allow the Copy, Paste, or Send action when the source
object or target path is located on an independent ASP.

<h3><a id="9.13"></a>9.13 Secure Shell (SSH) Terminal</h3>
<p>
For platforms where a Secure Shell exists by default or has been installed, the SSH Terminal feature
will appear on the IBM i Access Client Solutions main GUI.  SSH Terminal will launch a terminal emulator
to the IBM i integrated file system.
<p>
Most Mac, Linux, and other UNIX-derived systems already have a Secure Shell by default. For these platforms,
it is assumed an OpenSSH client exists and is located at /usr/bin/ssh.  Windows users will need to install
one of the Secure Shells available for Windows.
<p>
Secure Shells supported by IBM i Access Client Solutions:
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xterm, XterminalEmulator, MateTerminal, Terminator, GnomeTerminal, Konsole, Xfce4
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mac:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminal, iTerm2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows: cygwin, PuTTY, bash
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cygwin requires the openssh package to be installed
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bash is available as part of the Linux subsystem for Windows

<p>
If there are multiple SSH applications installed, you can use the com.ibm.iaccess.PreferredSSHClient property to
set the preferred SSH client.
<p>Linux examples:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.PreferredSSHClient=XterminalEmulator
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.PreferredSSHClient=MateTerminal
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.PreferredSSHClient=Terminator
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.PreferredSSHClient=GnomeTerminal
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.PreferredSSHClient=Konsole
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.PreferredSSHClient=Xfce4
<p>Mac examples:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.PreferredSSHClient=iTerm2
<p>Windows examples:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.PreferredSSHClient=Cygwin
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.PreferredSSHClient=Putty
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.PreferredSSHClient=Bash

<p>
For cases when the SSH client is not installed to the standard location, you can use the com.ibm.iaccess.PreferredSSHClient
property to provide the fully-qualified path to the installed SSH client.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.PreferredSSHClient=C:\PuTTY\putty.exe

<p>
When the fully-qualified path is provided, you may also need to set com.ibm.iaccess.SSHClientOpt to provide
all necessary arguments. For example, to disable warnings if you don't use X11 forwarding:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.ibm.iaccess.SSHClientOpts=-x

<h3><a id="9.13.1"></a>9.13.1 SSH Terminal Prerequisites</h3>
Install 5733-SC1 IBM Portable Utilities for i on the IBM i.
<br>Start the Secure Shell Daemon using the command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STRTCPSVR *SSHD

<p>If you receive a connection error within the launched SSH client (for example, "connection refused"),
or if a window pops up but immediately vanishes, you may need to start the SSH daemon with the above command.


<hr><h3><a id="10.0"></a>10.0 Service Diagnostics</h3>
<p>
If you encounter a problem which requires IBM service, your IBM service
representative may direct you to do one or both of the following:
<p>
From the main IBM i Access Client Solutions GUI:<br>
<ul>
 <li>select Tools-&gt;Generate Service Logs<br>
     This performs the same function as the command-line option in section
     <a href="#9.1.5">9.1.5 Dump</a>.  This function should normally be done immediately after
     the failure.  Depending on the problem, your IBM service representative
     may direct you to do this multiple times.
 <li>select Tools-&gt;Package Service Logs<br>
     This performs the same function as the command-line option in section
     <a href="#9.1.6">9.1.6 Medic</a>.  This function gathers details about the workstation
     environment and packages the service logs into a zip archive that can be
     sent to IBM.
</ul>



<hr><h3><a id="11.0"></a>11.0 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
<p>
<pre>
Q1    When I try to start IBM i Access Client Solutions I get the following
      error:
             class cannot be loaded: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError
A1-1  You need to use JDK 6.0 or higher.  See section <a href="#3.0">3.0 Prerequisites</a>

Q2    When I try to start the product using one of the provided binary files or
      scripts from a shell or terminal session, I get the following error:
         Permission denied
A2-1  Check the file permissions of the file to make sure you have execute
      permission.   See section <a href="#6.0">6.0 File Permissions</a>.

Q3    When I double-click on one of the provided files to start the product,
      nothing happens.
A3-1  Java may not be installed.   See section <a href="#3.0">3.0 Prerequisites</a>
A3-2  The file you are using to start the product may not have execute
      permission.  See section <a href="#6.0">6.0 File Permissions</a>.
A3-3  There may be problems with your environment.  To see what errors may be
      occurring, try running the provided file from a command line.
      See section <a href="#7.3">7.3 Starting the Product (using the command-line)</a>.

Q4    I want to use one of the binary files to start the product, but I get the
      following error:  "Error loading Java module."
A4-1  The binary was unable to locate the home directory of the java
      installation.
      Please verify java is installed.   See section <a href="#3.0">3.0 Prerequisites</a>.
A4-2  Section <a href="#7.1.1">7.1.1 Starting the Product - Additional Options</a>
      contains additional methods for starting the product using a binary file.

Q5    After I set the JAVA_HOME environment variable, the binary file I use to
      start the product works from a command-line, but does not work when I

      file manager and try to double-click the binary file again.

Q6    When I double-click on one of the provided files to start the product, a
      text editor displays the file.
A6-1  Make sure you are using a script that has a file extension your operating
      system recognizes.
A6-2  Try one of the other scripts.
A6-3  Change the program that opens the file.
A6-4  Check the file permissions of the file to make sure you have execute
      permission.   See section<a href="#6.0">6.0 File Permissions</a>.

Q7    When I double-click on one of the provided files to start the product, I am
      prompted for which program should be used to open the file.
A7-1  Make sure you are using a script that has a file extension your operating
      system recognizes.
A7-2  Set the program that opens the file to something compatible with the binary
      file or script you are using.  For example, Terminal (on Mac).
A7-3  Check the file permissions of the file to make sure you have execute
      permission.   See section<a href="#6.0">6.0 File Permissions</a>.

Q8    When I start IBM i Access Client Solutions on a Mac from Finder, a
      terminal session pops up and does not go away even after ending
      IBM i Access Client Solutions.
A8-1  To eliminate the terminal session from popping up, use the install scripts
      for Mac in the QuickStartGuide.

Q9    What is the best way to start the product?
A9-1  You may start the product with any of the three methods in section
      <a href="#7.0">7.0 Starting the Product</a> using either the binaries, scripts, or the
      command-line.  Any method that works in your environment is acceptable.

Q10   Why are there both binary files (Start_Programs) and scripts
      (Sample_Scripts) for starting the product?
A10-1 The scripts are not operating system specific and provide a more generic
      way to start the product when the platform specific binary file does not work.
A10-2 Some operating systems require binaries when defining file associations.
      For most cases, the binary files should be used to start the product.
A10-3 Some environments may have firewalls that restrict access to portions of
      IBM i Access Client Solutions.  Using one of the binary files to start the
      product will make it easier for system administrators to authorize access.

Q11   After installing JDK 6.0 (or higher), I am still getting the following
      error:
      class cannot be loaded: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError
A11-1 The default version of java being used on your workstation is prior to
      JDK 6.0.  You will need to use an option that explicitly specifies the
      path to the Java home for JDK 6.  See section <a href="#7.1.2">7.1.2 Finding the Java
      Home Path</a>.  Use the Java home path for one of the methods described in
      either of the following sections:
      <a href="#7.1.1">7.1.1 Starting the Product - Additional Options</a><br>
      <a href="#7.3">7.3 Starting the Product (using the command-line)</a><br>

Q12   I am not able to import customized keyboard mapping files (.kmp) from
      my Windows 5250 emulator sessions.
A12-1 In the initial version of IBM i Access Client Solutions which became
      available in July 2012, importing .kmp files from Windows 5250 emulator
      session profiles (.ws) was not supported.  As of the version which
      became available in October 2012, importing .kmp files from 5250
      session profiles (.ws) is now supported.

Q13   Keyboard customization for the 5250 emulator is a lot different than it
      was on Windows.  Do you have any suggestions?
A13-1 Keyboard mapping is divided into categories.  From an emulator session:
      Click Edit &gt; Preference &gt; Keyboard, or click the Remap button on the
         toolbar.
      Click the Key Assignment tab.
      Select a Category.  Default key mappings will appear under the
         "Host Functions" and the "Menu Commands" categories.
      Select the function you want to assign.
      Click Assign a Key.
      On your keyboard, press the key (or key combination) you want to assign
         to this function.
A13-2 For help on custom key mappings:
      Click Edit &gt; Preference &gt; Keyboard, or click the Remap button on the
      toolbar.  Select the Help button.

Q14   When I try to start the product on Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, I get
      a pop up message indicating the application is not signed.
A14-1 This is a security policy enforced by default beginning with Mac OS X
      10.8 Mountain Lion. See the following web page for how to enable the
      application to run:
      http://macperformanceguide.com/MountainLion-application-signing.html

Q21   When I select a help icon on a panel, no text is displayed.
A21-1 The help text is normally displayed in the desktop browser.  In some cases,
      the desktop may not have a browser or it may not be configured correctly.
A21-2 To display the help text without using the desktop browser, set the
      following property in the AcsConfig.properties file:
         com.ibm.iaccess.javaAwtDesktopAllowed=false
      Alternatively, the property may be set from from the command line like
      other java properties as follows:
         -Dcom.ibm.iaccess.javaAwtDesktopAllowed=false

Q22   When using Data Transfer, I select an Output device of either "Active Excel
      Spreadsheet" or "Active Calc Spreadsheet" and I get the following error:
         "Active Spreadsheet was not found"
Q22-1 There is no active spreadsheet.  Open either a new or existing spreadsheet
      and try the request again.
Q22-2 There may be a bitness mismatch between the spreadsheet application you are
      using and the Java Virtual Machine running IBM i Access Client Solutions.
      See section <a href="#9.8">9.8 Data Transfer Support for Excel and Calc Spreadsheets</a>

Q23   When using Data Transfer on a Mac, I do not see any options in Output
      device for interacting with an active spreadsheet.
Q23-1 Data Transfer is not able to interact with active spreadsheets on Mac due
      to the bitness mismatch between the OpenOffice application and the JVM
      running IBM i Access Client Solutions.  For additional details, see section
      <a href="#9.8">9.8 Data Transfer Support for Excel and Calc Spreadsheets</a>.

Q24   When using Data Transfer, I select an Output device of "Active Calc
      Spreadsheet" and nothing appears in the Name box.
Q24-1 This is normal for new Calc spreadsheets that have never been saved.
      DataTransfer will still be able to update the spreadsheet with downloaded
      data.
