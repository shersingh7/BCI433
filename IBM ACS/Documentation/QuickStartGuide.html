To deploy this product on the local disk drive for a single user, see the remaining sections of this document.

<hr><h3><a id="2.0"></a>2.0 Installation for Windows</h3>

<p>
Locate the product zip archive or product CD.

<p>
If you are using the product zip archive, extract the the contents of the zip archive.
<br>Suggestion: This can be done by using Windows Explorer to select the zip archive, then right-clicking on it, and then selecting "Extract All...".

<p>
Using Windows Explorer, locate the product's Windows_Application folder.

<p>
To install the 32 bit version for the current user, double-click on install_acs_32.
<p>
To install the 64 bit version for the current user, double-click on install_acs_64.
<p>
To install the 32 bit version for all users on a multi-user PC, double-click on install_acs_32_allusers.
<p>
To install the 64 bit version for all users on a multi-user PC, double-click on install_acs_64_allusers.

<p>
If this is a new installation, there will be several prompts that will help you customize
the initial installation.  If a license agreement appears, accept it.
<p>
If this is an upgrade, the previous settings will be preserved.
<p>
When the install has finished, a completion message will be displayed.

<p>
A successful single-user install will copy the application to:
<pre>
    /Users/user_id/IBM/ClientSolutions/
</pre>
<p>
Note: The initial version of these scripts copied the product files to a path relative to MyDocuments.
The current version copies the product files to a path based on the environment variables
%HOMEDRIVE% and %HOMEPATH%.  When using these scripts to update the product, updates will occur
to the first location found.
<p>
A successful multi-user install will copy the application to:
<pre>
    /Users/Public/IBM/ClientSolutions/
</pre>
<p>

<hr><h3><a id="2.0"></a>2.1 Starting the product on Windows</h3>
<p>
Double-click the "Access Client Solutions" icon on the desktop.


<hr><h3><a id="3.0"></a>3.0 Installation for Mac</h3>
<p>
Locate the product zip archive or CD using Finder.
<p>
If you are using the product zip archive, extract the the contents of the zip archive.
<br>Suggestion: If you just downloaded the product,
look in Downloads.  If the contents of the zip archive have not been extracted,
then you may extract the contents of the zip archive by double-clicking it.  
<p>
Locate the Mac_Application folder.   Double click install_acs

<p>
If this is a new installation, there will be several prompts that will help you customize
the initial installation.  If a license agreement appears, accept it.
<p>
If this is an upgrade, the previous settings will be preserved.
<p>
When the install has finished, a completion message will be displayed.
<p>
A successful install will copy the application to the Applications folder.

<p>
If you started the install from Finder, a terminal window was opened to perform the installation. When
the installation is complete, you can close the terminal window.
<p>
Tech Note:<br>
Depending on your security settings and the version of OS X you are using,
you may get a pop-up window indicating install_acs is not authorized to run.
If that happens, you will need to authorize install_acs to run by using one of
following methods:<br>
<ul>
<li>If you are presented with an option to "Open" install_acs, then select it.
<li>Right-click on install_acs and select "Open".<br>
   When presented with a pop-up window, select "Open".
<li>If neither of the above options work, then go to:<br>
    System Preferences...<br>
    Security &amp; Privacy<br>
    If there is an option to Open "IBM i Access Client Solutions", select it.
    Otherwise, you will need to adjust the settings on the General tab to allow other
    applications to run.  After "IBM i Access Client Solutions" starts the first
    time, you may change your security settings back.  
</ul>

<hr><h3><a id="3.1"></a>3.1 Starting the product on Mac</h3>
<p>
Use Finder to go to Applications.
<p>
Locate "IBM i Access Client Solutions" and double click it to start the product.
<p>
Tech Note:<br>
Depending on your security settings and the version of OS X you are using,
you may get a pop-up window indicating the application is not authorized to run.
If that happens, you will need to authorize the application to run by using one
of the following methods:<br>
<ul>
<li>If you are presented with an option to "Open" it, select it.
<li>Right-click on the "IBM i Access Client Solutions" icon and select "Open".<br>
   When presented with a pop-up window, select "Open".
<li>If neither of the above options work, then go to:<br>
    System Preferences...<br>
    Security &amp; Privacy<br>
    If there is an option to Open "IBM i Access Client Solutions", select it.
    Otherwise, you will need to adjust the settings on the General tab to allow other
    applications to run.  After "IBM i Access Client Solutions" starts the first
    time, you may change your security settings back.  
</ul>
Tech Notes:<br>
<ul>
<li>If you are prompted to install "Java 6 SE runtime", you do not need to install
Java 6.  Install Java 8 and then try to start the product again.
<li>When installing Java on Mac, select a JDK instead of a JRE.  The JRE for Mac installs Java for only the browser.
It does not install Java for other applications.  Installing the JDK will make Java available to other
applications such as IBM i Access Client Solutions.
</ul>

<hr><h3><a id="4.0"></a>4.0 Installation for Linux</h3>
<p>
Locate the product zip archive or product CD.
<p>
If you are using the product zip archive, extract the the contents of the zip archive.
<br>Suggestion: From a terminal window, use the unzip command.
<p>
Locate the Linux_Application folder.
<p>
Since you will need to have root authority to use the install script, use
sudo to run the install script from a terminal window.  For example:
<p>
If you are on a 32 bit architecture, use the following command:<br>
<pre>
    sudo ./install_acs_32
</pre>
If you are on a 64 bit architecture, use the following command:<br>
<pre>
    sudo ./install_acs_64
</pre>

<p>
If this is a new installation, there will be several prompts that will help you customize
the initial installation.  If a license agreement appears, accept it.
<p>
If this is an upgrade, the previous settings will be preserved.
<p>
When the install has finished, a completion message will be displayed.

<p>
A successful install will copy the application to:<br>
<pre>
    /opt/ibm/iAccessClientSolutions/
    /usr/share/applications/
</pre>



<hr><h3><a id="4.1"></a>4.1 Starting the product on Linux</h3>
<p>
Search for "IBM i Access Client Solutions" in the applications folder or by using the Super key and then typing
"IBM i Access Client Solutions". 



<hr><h3><a id="5.0"></a>5.0 Installing Updates</h3>
<p>
When a new version becomes available, you can follow the installation
instructions in this document to apply the updates.  If you are prompted to
overlay existing files, answer with "Yes to all".
<p>
If you are using the install_acs scripts for Windows, Mac or Linux, the
AcsConfig.properties file will not be updated so any custom configuration
changes you have made to that file will not be lost.



<hr><h3><a id="6.0"></a>6.0 More Information</h3>
<p>

problems while installing or starting the product, see the <a href="../Documentation/GettingStarted_en.html">GettingStarted</a> document
located in the Documentation folder.

<hr><h3><a id="7.0"></a>7.0 Uninstall</h3>
